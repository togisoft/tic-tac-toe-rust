# Tic-Tac-Toe in Rust

This is a simple terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Rust. The game allows two players to play against each other by taking turns to place their marks (`X` and `O`) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
